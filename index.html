        <h2>What Are Weaver Ants?</h2>

        <p>Weaver ants (genus Oecophylla) are insects known for their nests. They use silk produced by their larvae to weave together leaves into nests, creating complex ant-societys high in the trees.</p>
        <p>Weaver ants form large colonies with hundreds of thousands of individuals, usually only from one queen who only mated once. The colony is headed by a queen and worker ants work together in ways that hasnt been shown in different species of ants. Ants join their legs and arms to make "ant ladders" that help other ants get up and deliver whatever they needed.</p>
        <p>These ants are primarily found in tropical Asia, Africa, and Australia. They inhabit these lands because they have the right conditions they need in order t make nests. The trees in these areas are also tall, and structured enough for the ants to make their homes in these trees..</p>

        <h2>Ecology</h2>

        <P>Ants have been around for hundreds of millions of years. In that time, ants have not only benefitted and evolved themselves, but also helped the plants and animals around them. </P>
        <p>Ants have had this back and forth relationship for millions of years, which inevitably contributed to the environment in many ways. These wonderful, inteligent creatures have been around longer then dinosours. These creatures have withstood the toughest of environment changes, and still manage to thrive today just off of other plants and animals. Weaver Ants have also been proven important because they are natural pest killers. Farmers have found that using ants in orchards to keep pests away rather then chemicals is not only beneficial for the plants but the ants aswell.
